# CDA
This application provides a widely adaptable Continuous Double Auction (CDA) in oTree v5 via a complete implementation of an experimental asset market with mutliple continuously operating traders and multiple assets. Permission of use of this software is granted for educational and academic purpose with the requirement of citation.

## Overview
This continuous double auction software is provided in two apps, since one covers a simplicistic version with a single asset and more convenient data export, while the other captures markets with multiple (n) assets which are summerised in variables with JSON format.

## Installation
This software is developed for oTree 5.10.2 using python 3.11.1. To make adaptions to it, you may need to download both softwares, which are available free of charge at [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and oTree via: 
```
pip3 install -U otree
```
From here, you may add a new project, and add this app to it.
