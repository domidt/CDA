    <p>Thank you for participating in this experiment</p>

<b>Background of the experiment</b>

<p>
This experiment replicates an asset market. You are a member of a group that consists of yourself and your classmates.
    The composition of your group will remain unchanged throughout the entire experiment and you will only interact with people from your group.
    The experiment consists of 1 trading periods.
    </p>

<b>Your role during the experiment</b>
<p>
    At the beginning of the experiment, a quarter participants are assigned the role of active market participants (traders) who take part in the asset markets and can buy or sell assets of a fictitious company.
    The remaining participant is a passive market
participant (observer ) who observes the events on the market but cannot actively
participate in the market. The assignment to one of the roles remains unchanged
throughout the whole experiment. You will now receive more information about
the trader and observer roles.
