<h3>Background of the experiment</h3>

<p>
    This experiment replicates an asset market.
    You are a member of a group that consists of yourself and your classmates.
    The composition of your group will remain unchanged throughout the entire experiment and you will only interact with people from your group.
    The experiment consists of 1 trial and 1 trading periods.
    </p>

<p>
    In this experiment you can buy and sell securities corresponding the value of a jars filled with coins (€2, €1, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1 cents).
    Following a trial period, you will receive more information about this jar.
    You will be trading in a continuous double auction.
    This means that every trader can act as a buyer and as a seller.
    You can submit as many buy and sell orders as you wish by entering a price (with a maximum of two decimal places) and the amount of assets you are willing to trade.
    Prices and the amount of assets traded are only determined by the actions of traders.
    If you buy or sell assets, your cash and asset holdings will change accordingly.
    Every trading period ends automatically after 5 minutes.
</p>

<h3>Buyback value of the assets</h3>

<p>
    At the end of each trading period, your asset holdings will be taken over by the experimenter in return for the buyback value.
    The latter is defined by the coins contained in the jar, i.e., the summed products of coin types multiplied by coin values in the jar.
</p>

<h3>Information about the coins in the jar</h3>

<p>
    Before the trading period starts, some traders will receive information about the amount of some coin values in the jar; for example, the number of all 50 cent coins in the jar.
    There is a total of four information levels (I0, I1, I2, I3).
    Out of the participants, a quarter will receive the same information.
    Depending on your information level, you will learn the number of none, two, or three types of coins contained in the jar.
    You will also learn the value of these coins.
    A participant with information level I0 learns nothing about the number of coins;
    I1 learns the number and value of the €1 and 5 cent coins;
    I2 the number and value of the €2 and 2 cent coins,
    and I3 the number and value of the 50, 20, and 10 cent coins.
    Nobody learns the number or value of the 1 cent coins.
    The information structure looks as follows:
    </p>

<table>
    <thead align="center">
    <tr>
        <th></th><th>€2</th><th>€1</th><th>50c</th><th>20c</th><th>10c</th><th>5c</th><th>2c</th><th>1c</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>I0</th><td class="border"></td><td class="border"></td><td class="border"></td><td class="border"></td><td class="border"></td><td class="border"></td><td class="border"></td><td class="border"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>I1</th><td class="border"></td><td class="border">known</td><td class="border"></td><td class="border"></td><td class="border"></td><td class="border">known</td><td class="border"></td><td class="border"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>I2</th><td class="border">known</td><td class="border"></td><td class="border"></td><td class="border"></td><td class="border"></td><td></td><td class="border">known</td><td class="border"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>I3</th><td class="border"></td><td class="border"></td><td class="border">known</td><td class="border">known</td><td class="border">known</td><td class="border"></td><td class="border"></td><td class="border"></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<br>

<p>
    At the start of the period, the jar will be handed out to be inspected by the participants (you will receive the same jar and each one can view it, handle it, etc. for 15 seconds).
</p>

<h3>Cash and asset endowments at the beginning of the period</h3>
<p>
    At the beginning of each trading period, all traders receive between {{ C.num_assets_MIN }} and {{ C.num_assets_MAX }} assets and a certain amount of euros to be able to make transactions (purchases and sales of assets).
    Note that the endowments of assets and euros are newly determined at beginning of every period and are NOT carried over to the next trading period.
    </p>

<h3>Credit limit</h3>
<p>
    In addition to the initial endowment of cash at the beginning of the trading period, every trader receives a credit limit equal to the size of the initial euro endowment.
    This means that every trader can use all the euros for buying assets, and in addition, can purchase assets by utilizing the credit limit (displayed as negative cash holdings).
    </p>

<h3>Short sale of assets</h3>
<p>
    Similar to the cash holdings, at the beginning of the trading period, every trader is provided with an endowment of assets for short sales equal to the size of the initial asset endowment.
    This means, that every trader can sell all his assets, and in addition, can sell assets up to the short sale limit (shown by negative asset holdings).
</p>

<h3>Calculation of your payout as a trader</h3>
<p>
As a trader, your fictual payout in euros is based on one the period incomes.
    For the calculation of a period income, the initial wealth is determined by multiplying your initial asset endowment with the buyback value and adding the initial endowment of cash.
    As a next step, your final wealth is determined.
    For the final wealth, the asset and cash holdings at the end of the period are used.
    This approach is also applied in case of negative asset or taler holdings at the end of the period.
    In other words, for the calculation of the final wealth, potentially negative taler holdings are balanced with the value of the assets and potentially negative asset holdings are balanced with the cash holdings.
    With the mentioned values, a percentage wealth change is calculated for this period:
</p>
<p>
    Wealth change (%) = (final wealth − initial wealth)/(initial wealth)</p>

<p>
    The percentage wealth change is multiplied by {{ C.multiplier }} and added to a basic income of {{ C.base_payment }}.
    Please note that the period income can not become less than 0 euros.
    Therefore, the calculation is:
</p>
<p>
Period income = max({0; {{ C.base_payment }} + wealth change · {{ C.multiplier }}})
    </p>
<p>
Example: At the end of the period you have 60 assets and 300 taler.
    The buyback value of the asset is 50.00.
    Therefore, your final wealth in this period is 60 · 50.00 + 300 = 3,300.
    Your initial endowment in this period was for example 50 assets and 500 taler, which results in an initial wealth of 50 · 50.00 + 500 = 3,000.
    This leads to a wealth change of (3,300−3,000)/3,000 = 10.00% and a period income of {{ C.base_payment }} + 0.1 · {{ C.multiplier }} = €34.
    If, however, the wealth change of the period equals -10.00%, the period income will be {{ C.base_payment }} + −0.1 · {{ C.multiplier }}= €16.
</p>

    <h3>Market mechanism</h3>
<p>
On the top of the trading screen, you can see a countdown that shows the remaining time to market closing.
Trades can only be executed before market closing.
</p>
<b>Your endowment and how to interpret your information</b>
<p>
    Underneath the countdown, you may find information about your current cash and asset holdings, and the credit and short sale limit.
    In the next box, you may find your information about coins.
    There is a table in this box that specifies your information, i.e., the number of coins, the nominal value, and the product of column 1 and column 2.
    Only those coins are represented in this table that you are allowed to know, given your information level.
    Thus, the sum of the products in column 3 plus the sum of the coins that you are not informed about result in the jar's value.
</p>

<b>How to place an offer (limit order)</b>
<p>
    You may place an offer to buy assets specifying the bid price and the amount of assets (volume) you would like to purchase and using the button "Place bid offer".
    Similarly, you may place an offer to sell assets specifying the ask price and the amount of assets (volume) you would like to sell and using the button "Place ask offer".
    You cannot offer more assets to buy or to sell than your credit and short sale limits allow.
    In the case, it may be advantageous to withdraw another less interesting offer first.
</p>

<b>How to accept an offer (market order)</b>
<p>
    Underneath the boxes, which allow you to place a limit order, you find boxes with all the currently available offers.
    All offers will be sorted by price, such that the best will be on top.
    The best order can be accepted selecting the offer of interest, specifying the amount of asset you want to sell (bid offer) or purchase (ask offer), and confirming your order using the buttons “Accept sale” or “Accept purchase”.
    When you buy assets, your euro balance will decrease by the price times the amount of assets and your balance of assets will increase by the amount of assets.
    Conversely, when you sell assets, your euro balance will increase by the price times the amount of assets and your balance of assets will decrease by the amount of assets.
</p>

<p>
    Please note that you can only accept offers from other traders, i.e., you cannot accept your own limit orders which are framed in red color.
    You can still select your own limit orders which can be useful if you would like to withdraw a own limit order using the button 'Withdraw own limit order'.
