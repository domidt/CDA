<h3>Background of the experiment</h3>

<p>
    This experiment replicates an asset market.
    You are a member of a group that consists of yourself and your classmates.
    The composition of your group will remain unchanged throughout the entire experiment and you will only interact with people from your group.
    The experiment consists of {{ numTrials }} trial and {{ numRounds }} independent trading periods.
    </p>

<p>
    In this experiment you can buy and sell securities corresponding the value of a jars filled with coins (€2, €1, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1 cents).
    Following a trial period, you will receive more information about this jar.
    You will be trading in a continuous double auction.
    This means that every trader can act as a buyer and as a seller.
    You can submit as many buy and sell orders as you wish by entering a price (with a maximum of two decimal places) and the amount of assets you are willing to trade.
    Prices and the amount of assets traded are only determined by the actions of traders.
    If you buy or sell assets, your cash and asset holdings will change accordingly.
    Every trading period ends automatically after 5 minutes.
</p>

<h3>Buyback value of the assets</h3>

<p>
    At the end of each trading period, your asset holdings will be taken over by the experimenter in return for the buyback value.
    The latter is defined by the coins contained in the jar, i.e., the summed products of coin types multiplied by coin values in the jar.
